             <p class="p_content">
                 My name is Rob Mordkin and I'm a urologist practicing in Arlington, VA. Recently, a group of colleagues and I envisioned an online community specifically designed for urologists to collaborate and consult with each other. To make this a reality, we've teamed up with Skipta, a company in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with extensive expertise in the medical networking space.
</p><p class="p_content">
Our vision is to create a trusted, secure, online collaborative environment for the exclusive use of urologists only. Once inside the site, we can all share challenging cases for feedback and help, seek consultation for the tough questions that come up in our practices everyday, and access relevant clinical information, all in one area.
</p><p class="p_content">
For this new network to reach it’s maximum potential, we need help. We are a small group of excited urologists on a journey to make a positive impact on our profession and we believe there are other passionate colleagues that can assist in making this platform the best it can be. We are looking forward to collaborating with you! 
            </p>
